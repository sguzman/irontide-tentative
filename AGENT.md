# Agent Instructions

This repository aims to implement a Rust version of the [Newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat) feed reader. Contributions should move the project toward feature parity with the original application while following idiomatic Rust practices.

When modifying the codebase:

- Use the 2024 edition of Rust and prefer stable features where possible.
- Run `cargo fmt -- --check` and `cargo check` before committing. If tests are added, also run `cargo test`.
- Document new features or changes in `README.md`.
